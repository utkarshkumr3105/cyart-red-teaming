# cyart-red-teaming

This repository contains practical cybersecurity tasks completed as part of the CYART Red Teaming / Cybersecurity Internship program.

## Structure

## Week 2
  - Consolidated practical report covering Tasks 1–8
  - Workflow and incident response diagrams
  - Screenshots and documentation

## Key Topics Covered

- Threat Hunting with Sigma Rules
- Malware Analysis (Static & Dynamic)
- Vulnerability Assessment (OpenVAS)
- Incident Response (SANS Framework)
- Network Defense (Suricata)
- Risk Assessment (ALE & Risk Matrix)
- Capstone Incident Response Project

All work was conducted in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes.


## Week 3
# Red Team Practical Application & Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains a **hands-on Red Team Practical Application and Capstone Project** focused on simulating real-world offensive security operations in a **controlled and authorized lab environment**. The project demonstrates the complete red team attack lifecycle, aligned with the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, using open-source security tools.

All activities were performed ethically using **intentionally vulnerable virtual machines, test accounts, and simulated data**.

---

## Objectives
- Perform end-to-end red team operations
- Understand attacker techniques across the cyber kill chain
- Gain hands-on experience with offensive security tools
- Map techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Document findings in professional red team reports

---

## Lab Environment
- **Attacker:** Kali Linux VM  
- **Victims:** Windows VM, Metasploitable2/3  
- **Network:** Isolated lab (NAT / Host-only)  
- **Tools:** Open-source offensive security tools

## Practical Application (Tasks 1–7)

### Task 1: OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Recon-ng, Shodan, Maltego  
- Identified public assets and exposed services

### Task 2: Phishing Simulation
- Gophish, Evilginx2  
- Simulated credential harvesting via phishing

### Task 3: Vulnerability Exploitation
- Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Metasploit  
- Exploited a vulnerable web application

### Task 4: Lateral Movement & Persistence
- Impacket (PsExec)  
- Established persistence using scheduled tasks

### Task 5: Social Engineering (Vishing)
- PhoneInfoga, Maltego  
- Simulated phone-based social engineering

### Task 6: Exploit Development Basics
- GDB, radare2  
- Identified and tested a buffer overflow vulnerability

### Task 7: Post-Exploitation & Exfiltration
- Mimikatz  
- Simulated DNS-based data exfiltration

---

## Capstone Project
The capstone project combines all practical tasks into a **single end-to-end red team engagement**, covering:

1. Reconnaissance & OSINT  
2. Initial Access  
3. Exploitation  
4. Lateral Movement  
5. Persistence  
6. Post-Exploitation  
7. Simulated Data Exfiltration  
8. Blue Team Detection Review  
9. Final Reporting & Recommendations

## Attack Flow
Recon → Initial Access → Exploitation → Lateral Movement → Persistence → Post-Exploitation → Exfiltration → Reporting
